# deep_learning_reu
GAN code for generating 3d lung nodule ct scans From LIDC data.
Data can be found at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI.
Some data preprocessing files are not present in this repository, so you may have to write your own (basically just getting and sorting the dicom images into a dictionary).
