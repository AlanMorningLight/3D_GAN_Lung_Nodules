# 3D_GAN_Lung_Nodules
This is the code for an undegraduate research program at DePaul University.

It contains code for generating 3D lung nodule ct scans From LIDC data through a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). 

The data can be found at https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI (this is large, ~100 gb).

Some data preprocessing files are not present in this repository, so you may have to write your own (getting and sorting the dicom images into a dictionary).
